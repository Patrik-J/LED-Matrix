# LED Matrix 
This is part of a bigger project where I aim to built of a LED-strip and a LED-Matrix with several cool functions.

## General
For the LED-Matrix my goal is to have it have at least three different functionalities:
1. Reacting to music 
2. Clock
3. Maybe somehow displaying the played music by connecting to spotify? 


## Built with
* (Mainly) C

## Needed Hardware
Probably at least one Arduino, as a RP Pico probably wont be enough. Maybe even a small RP Pi (i.e. 3A etc.).
Just for the LED-Matrix, I will need at least 260 LEDs, as to have the construct a total width of 80cm and height 
of approx. 50cm. I plan for the LEDs to have a spacing of 4cm in between them. 
Now that I am mentioning it, I'll need to 3D-print some kind of holder for all these LEDs.
